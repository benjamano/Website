                <h2>About</h2>
                <h3>My name's Ben, and I'm really passionate in full stack web design, ever since I designed my first website for my Computer Science NEA, a passion has developed to develop the aestetic and logical aspects of a sight. I dream to make it a full time job in the future.</h3>
                <h3>I really enjoy designing, developing and implementing different full-stack websites. I enjoy designing my own sites and following a constant theme and design.</h3>

                <h3>I've always been passionate about computers and software development from a very young age, mainly encouraged by my dad who, I remember, introduced me to a "Lego Mindstorms" set, which allowed an external computer to program a little robot to do tasts, such as lift his hat as a greeting</h3>

                <!-- TODO ADD ROBOT PHOTO-->

                <h3>I've always been interested in design generally, mainly beggining from my A-Level ICT coursework, where I was tasked to create posts for social media, at the time, I worked at Play2Day, A local child's play centre, who had social media accounts, I was given access to these accounts for my coursework to create and post content, I really enjoyed designing and actually creating these posts which gave me a real sense of achievement as I saw the engagement go up as I replaced the old posts with the new.</h3>
                <h3>What I'm trying to say here is - I really enjoy designing content, I'm also really good at commiting myself to the cause, as long after my coursework finished (I got a distinction) I was still actively posting and designing new content for their social media pages, as I genuinly enjoyed it.</h3>
